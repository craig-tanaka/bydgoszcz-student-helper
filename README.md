# Bydgoszcz Student Helper

A website focused on helping students prepare for university life in another city. This can serve as a template for creating an education based website, with the ability for admin users to upload courses, that have quizzes at the end of each video lesson

This was a project I did for my university coursework and as such the project is not as complete as it could be as after grading I had to move on to other coursework. 

A link to a live version of the site can be found [here](https://bydgoszcz-student-helper.web.app/index.html)
